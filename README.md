Downloads and Socket Communication
=============================
standalone.py (WARNING: Uses many techniques that I now know are poor. Need to update.) - Demonstrates downloading multiple file types from the internet and using them with python.

getter.py and display.py - Server and client apps. The getter downloads images from the internet and sends them to the display(s) when they request them. There can be many displays connected to one server(getter), up to the limit(currently set at 15).
